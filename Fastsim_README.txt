Fastsim special instructions go here (if I get Fastsim working)
Topics 
- dbs queries often timeout; how to manually use MCM to copy in filenames for neutrino gun or premixed pileup
- diagnosing missing (zero products matching all criteria) errors. The type_label_instance_process convention. Process names for each step (why they're irrelevant but might conflict). keeping and dropping products. edmDump to match collections with a root from official production, if available.
- common errors at the moment
- excessive memory usage / memory spikes by fastsim (hypernews links)
